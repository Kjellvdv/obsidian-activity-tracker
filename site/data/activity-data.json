Since I got more experience with webhooks now, I gave it another shot and it was easier than expected. Starting with a script for Webflow written by ChatGPT, it was easy enough to connect it to n8n and send back replies to the web page.  Styling it was something I could easily do manually as well. Pretty happy with the result. ![[Screenshot 2026-01-29 at 16",
