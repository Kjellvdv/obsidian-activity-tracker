And I also got 12 last year. They're only 2cl each but I want a place to track and rate them.\n\nClaude Code very quickly created an HMTL file that basically does everything. It seemed functional, but no separate style sheet and no separate database sound wrong to me.\n\nClaude split it up into a js server, json files for data and css style sheet. Still looks the same. Impressive. \n\nCurrently no public repo, might push it later if it looks better.\n\nSeparating tabs for collection and adding a new entry really made it look better.\n\n---\n\nFebruary 4, 2026\n\nTried to implement voice transcription as well last night, but that didn't seem to work because it needs internet access and this is a local app (for now).\nSo I'm going to include OCR instead to speed up text input. That seems to work better.\nI'm also making some changes to the layout and card field: adding years of aging and putting it in two columns so it stays in one screen.",

Believe it or not, I coded this manually with some HTML and CSS. At least I have the feeling that I contributed a bit now.\n\n---\n\nFebruary 4, 2026\n\nMade some small changes to how projects and days are being parsed.\nOne project per note file: Each Obsidian note is now treated as a single project, regardless of how many date sections (H2 headers) it contains. \nChronological ordering: Date sections within a note are now sorted chronologically (oldest to newest) before being processed and aggregated.\nAggregated content: All work sessions from different dates are combined into a single project entry with:\n• The earliest date as the main project date\n• All content from all sessions aggregated\n• All learnings combined\n• Maximum intensity across all sessions\n• A new workDates array that tracks all the dates you worked on that project\nClean titles: Project titles no longer have \"(Day 1)\", \"(Day 2)\" labels.\n\n---\n\nFebruary 5, 2026\n\nThe changes from yesterday didn't really work out the way I wanted.\nI trusted Claude to just change everything at once but it didn't work.\nI then tried again, giving more and clearer instructions but it almost reversed the changes instead.\nToday, I tried implementing the small changes one by one, instead.",

The reply gets sent back to the same slack channel.\n\n---\n\nJanuary 29, 2026\n\nSally lives on ww.willow.co/success-stories too now.\nBeen wanting to implement this for months but never felt confident about how to do it.\nSince I got more experience with webhooks now, I gave it another shot and it was easier than expected.\nStarting with a script for Webflow written by ChatGPT, it was easy enough to connect it to n8n and send back replies to the web page. \nStyling it was something I could easily do manually as well.\nPretty happy with the result.",
